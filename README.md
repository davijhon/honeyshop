# HoneyShop
<table>
<tr>
<td>
  This is a web app built on Django to emulate a honey products E-commerce. This was my firts web created using Django, and basically I play a lot with the frontend because I didn't know almost anything about HTML & CSS. It was a really good way to practice and facing with a lot of problems to design the frontend. 

  On other hand, I tried to add a good backend logic, with an authentication systemn to buyers, backend logic to buy honey products, like a product list and also a basket, also integration with PayPal to perform a payment method systemn, with billings and more..
